# GoldenCheetah OpenData

The GoldenCheetah Open Data project was started in January 2018.

It aims to create an open access database of endurance exercise data
for use by amateurs, academics and professionals.

* The data is entirely anonymised, no personally identifiable information is stored or made available.

* The data consists of aggregate information about workouts and base information about the athlete that performed the workout (such as age and gender).

* The data is provided by users of the GoldenCheetah analysis application and is provided as-is with no warranty or liability.

The data is published under a creative commons license.
